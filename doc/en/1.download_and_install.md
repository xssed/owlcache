# Download & Compile   

## Compilation environment requirements    
>golang >= 1.9

## Source download  
* Go command download (will automatically download the dependent library, if you directly download the source code will prompt the class library is missing)    
* 'go get' command cannot be executed. Please check if the machine is installed with Git service and set Go environment.  

>go get -u github.com/xssed/owlcache  

## Open the owlcache home directory to execute the compile command  
>go build

## Run 
* Note that the owlcache.conf file should be in the same directory as the main program  
* Set the <Pass> option in the configuration file owlcache.conf.      

Linux  
>./owlcache

Windows (DOS)  
* Note: In the Windows production environment deployment, it is found that the memory release will be relatively slow after the query request processing, and will be released within about half an hour. Linux does not have this problem, which is related to Go's internal mechanism.  
>owlcache

Other platforms run the above reference, the same reason.  

### Parameter help  
* You can check out the help before running. 
* Note that the runtime configuration parameters take precedence over the configuration parameters in the *.conf file.
