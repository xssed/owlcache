## Expired cache cleanup
* The get command method is used to check the data, and the expiration is automatically cleared.
* Every minute owlcache automatically cleans up stale data. (cleanup time can be changed via configuration file)

## Logging
* Text log, the log file will be automatically split if it exceeds 5M, ensuring smooth running on the line.
* The location where log files are stored depends on the configuration of the configuration file.

## Data storage
* Every minute owlcache automatically backs up the data in memory to the hard disk(the time can be changed through the configuration file).
* But this also means that data that does not fall within the time interval may be lost.

## Data recovery
* When owlcache starts, `owlcache.db`、`auth.db`、`server_group_config.json`、`server_group_gossip_config.json` file, which automatically reloads the hard disk data into memory. It should be mentioned here that when reloading the data, if it is found that some data in `owlcache.db` and `auth.db` has expired, it will be discarded automatically.

## Memory information
* Owlcache automatically outputs the memory usage information to the log every minute (the time can be changed through the configuration file).
