## Expired cache cleanup
* The get command method is used to check the data, and the expiration is automatically cleared.
* Every minute owlcache automatically cleans up stale data. (cleanup time can be changed via configuration file)

## Logging
* Text log, the log file will be automatically split if it exceeds 7M, ensuring smooth running on the line.
* The location where log files are stored depends on the configuration of the configuration file.

## Data storage
* Every minute owlcache automatically backs up the data in memory to the hard disk.
* But this also means that data that does not fall within the time interval may be lost.

## Data recovery
* When owlcache starts, it will load owlcache.db, auth.db and server_group_config.json files, and automatically reload the hard disk data into memory. Here, if you reload data, if you find owlcache.db, auth.db Item data has expired and will be automatically discarded.
