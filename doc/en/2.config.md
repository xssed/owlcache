>2.Grouping information with [] (more intuitive display of configuration information)   
>3.The configuration parameter name and parameter value are separated by a space.     

## [Owlcache]
### Set the IP that the program listens
* If you cannot access the service after normal startup, please check whether the firewall or other software restricts your access.
>Host 0.0.0.0

### Set program response IP
* Default local
* Use it in the response result Json string returned by TCP and HTTP, pay attention to the correctness of the IP during actual deployment in the local area network and external network environment!
>ResponseHost 127.0.0.1

### Log file path
* The default log will be generated to the service running directory
* !!! If the Logfile value is specified when starting the service on the command line, and the configuration file is not commented out here, the configuration file shall prevail
>Logfile ./log_file/

### Database file path
* The default database file will be generated to the service running directory
>DBfile ./db_file/


## [TCP]
### TCP listening port
* The default is 7720
* If it is not filled in or the port value is 0, port 7720 will be monitored by default
>Tcpport 7720

### Whether to open the Tcp service
* No password authentication in TCP mode (for production environment deployment, please shield TCP access ports according to the actual situation, etc., pay attention to use safety)
* The values are "1" (open service) and "0" (close service). The default is 1 to enable the service.

* Please set your password. The length of the password must not be less than ten digits, and it cannot be a pure number. It is recommended to use uppercase letters + lowercase letters + numbers + simple symbols
>Pass 

### Tonken expiration time
* Set an expiration time for the Tonken value generated by the "Pass" command.
* The default is 0. The unit is seconds. If the value is 0, it will never expire.
* Warning: The setting never expires, there may be a security risk.
>Tonken_expire_time 0

### HTTPS related configuration

* Note: Be cautious of CSRF attacks.
>Cors 0

>Access_Control_Allow_Origin *


## [HttpGroupData]
### Request timeout time when the clusters communicate with each other
* The unit is milliseconds. The default timeout is 2700 milliseconds. In fact, the data intercommunication time of the intranet environment is very low, and it can be set according to the actual situation.
>HttpClientRequestTimeout 2700

### Http client request settings
* The requested data will be cached locally for a short time to avoid repeated frantically querying other nodes for the same Key in a high concurrency state. Appropriate delayed query helps optimize performance and efficiency.

* This item will take effect only when the cluster data synchronization service is enabled.
* The cluster data synchronization service relies on the Gossip protocol. It is recommended not to set this item, the system will automatically allocate ports. The default value is 0 (the system automatically monitors a port and outputs the port at startup).
>Gossipport 0

### The entire Gossip cluster needs a unified password
* This item will take effect only when the cluster data synchronization service is enabled.
* A token used to exchange data in the cluster through the Gossip protocol. The default is blank, you need to set the same password for the cluster.
>GossipDataSyncAuthKey 

### Request timeout time when cluster synchronization data communicate with each other
* The unit is milliseconds. The default timeout is 5000 milliseconds. In fact, the data intercommunication time of the intranet environment is very low, and it can be set according to the actual situation.
>GossipHttpClientRequestTimeout 5000


## [Memcache_Client]
### Turn on importing data from memcache
* Whether to enable query for non-existent data, query from memcache and save it in the local database. 0 means not open.
