# owlcache configuration file
* When the program starts, your dynamically configured parameters will overwrite the parameters in the *.conf file.  

## Profile writing convention
>1.Indicates that this line is a comment at the beginning of #    
>2.Grouping information with [] (more intuitive display of configuration information)   
>3.The configuration parameter name and parameter value are separated by a space.

* Set the program response IP, the default local
* Used in the response result Json string returned by TCP and HTTP. Pay attention to the correct IP of the actual deployment in the LAN and external network environment!

* If you do not fill in or the port value is 0, it will listen to port 7721 by default.
>Httpport 7721

### Logfile
* Log file path

* Warning: If there is a lot of data in the database, if the data is reloaded into memory when the service is restarted, exceeding the set backup time will cause the data entity file to be overwritten. This is a very serious data loss error.  
>Task_ServerListBackup 1

### Task_ServerGossipListBackup
* Timing Configuration - The time to automatically back up the Gossip service cluster information. Unit minutes. The default is 1.   
* Warning: If there is a lot of data in the database, if the data is reloaded into memory when the service is restarted, exceeding the set backup time will cause the data entity file to be overwritten. This is a very serious data loss error.
