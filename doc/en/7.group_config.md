If you find it troublesome to configure via HTTP protocol, you can directly edit the file `server_group_config.json`. When owlcache starts, the cluster configuration information will be loaded.


# The cluster mode and the introduction of the two cluster modes   
> If you want to use the cluster mode of websocket communication, your owlcache version must satisfy >=0.4.3  
We find the [GroupData_Mode] section in the configuration file. to set it up.    
* The owlcache cluster mode is divided into "Http" (non-persistent connection) and "Websocket" (persistent connection). There are two options. The default is "Http" non-persistent connection.  
* "Http" (non-persistent connection) to find the [HttpGroupData] configuration  
* "Websocket" (persistent connection) to find the [Websocket_Client] configuration  
>GroupData_Mode Http
Replace `Http` of `GroupData_Mode` with `Websocket`   
Some people here will question what is the difference between "Http" (non-persistent connection) and "Websocket" (persistent connection)?    
When querying data in the cluster, you can set up "Websocket" (persistent connection) if there is high concurrency and real-time query data. However, the number of responses to queries in the "Websocket" cluster mode is much lower than that in the "Http" cluster mode.      
The "Http" cluster mode provides a second-level cache, which improves efficiency. If there is no connection error between cluster services similar to the following in the log when you use it, you can continue to use the "Http" cluster method.    
>[{"message":[["owlclient method GetValue error:Post http://127.0.0.1:7727/data/?cmd=get\u0026key=hello: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:7727: connectex: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it."]],"time":"2022-01-13T16:46:48.8880053+08:00"}]
>[{"message":[["owlclient method GetValue error:Post http://127.0.0.1:7721/data/?cmd=get\u0026key=hello: net/http: request canceled (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)"]],"time":"2022-01-13T16:53:16.3804841+08:00"}]


# Cluster data synchronization configuration
* owlcache uses the Gossip protocol to achieve data synchronization between clusters. The author believes that loose synchronization will make the cluster more efficient.
* The Gossip protocol is a solution for eventual data consistency.
* The cluster information needs to be configured at startup, but the configuration is easy and simple.
* The data of each node will be automatically updated to the latest, although there is a delay, but the time is very short.


>Below we demonstrate how to configure a Gossip data exchange cluster. Suppose you plan to run three Owlcache Gossip services: 127.0.0.1:7726, 127.0.0.1:7727, 127.0.0.1:7728. <br>
(1) Set the GroupDataSync option in the owlcache.conf file to 1, and start the service<br>
(2) Change the Gossipport options in the owlcache.conf files of the three services to `7726`, `7727`, and `7728`<br>
(3) When Gossip serves a cluster, nodes need to authenticate their identity for data exchange. You need to set the <GossipDataSyncAuthKey> option value in the three owlcache.conf files to a uniform password. <br>
(4) Manually write the Gossip service cluster configuration file `server_group_gossip_config.json`<br>
~~~shell
[
	{
		"Cmd": "",
		"Address": "127.0.0.1:7726",
		"Pass": "",
		"Token": ""
	},
	{
		"Cmd": "",
		"Address": "127.0.0.1:7727",
		"Pass": "",
		"Token": ""
	},
	{
		"Cmd": "",
		"Address": "127.0.0.1:7728",
		"Pass": "",
		"Token": ""
	}
]
~~~  
(5)Put the `server_group_gossip_config.json` file into the data file directory (depending on the setting of the DBfile option in the configuration file), and then start the node.
In this way, the cluster is configured. When owlcache starts, the cluster configuration information will be loaded. The nodes will automatically contact each other. Assuming that node one is down, node two and node three will still maintain communication and update data.

>☆☆☆Of course, you can also configure the Gossip cluster through the HTTP protocol. Refer to the cluster configuration information and modify the HTTP request field `group_type` to `gossip`. 

## FAQ 

#### 1.owlcache does not have master-slave mode. If a key is written to a node and the node crashes, then the key cannot be accessed?？  
> The author believes that the master-slave mode will occupy a lot of server resources and cause excessive data redundancy(Exception: One Key maps multiple values). It is recommended that important keys can be written to more than two nodes at the same time when setting, so that the access to keys is almost unaffected in the relative case. If all nodes in the cluster are down, it is really impossible to access the key.   

#### 2.How to choose the cluster mode of owlcache?  
> There are three clustering modes of owlcache, namely "Http" (short link), "Websocket" (long link) and "Gossip" (data is eventually consistent).  
> ★If your business volume is small, you can choose the "Http" (short link) cluster method.  
> ★If your business volume is large, you can choose the "Websocket" (long link) cluster method.   
> ★The "Gossip" (data eventually consistent) clustering method does not conflict with the previous two clustering methods, and they can coexist. However, you need to pay attention to the configuration items and debug the complex server network environment. You can understand that the previous two methods are active clustering, and the latter is passive clustering,Used to synchronize data in the cluster.However, if you turn on "Gossip", the use case of your cluster having multiple values ​​for one key will become meaningless.
