## TCP Request
TCP communication adopts a text communication protocol similar to Memcache. The protocol format is `command + space + ...\n`.
For example, set a key value `set hello world\n`.
> Note that if you use telnet to connect to the server to send data `\n \r` these system line breaks will be stored in the value.

## HTTP request
HTTP communication uses the standard Http communication protocol. GET, POST...

## TCP&HTTP response
The format of the unified response data is the same format Json string.  
example:  
```shell
{
    "Cmd": "get",
    "Status": 200,
    "Results": "SUCCESS",
    "Key": "hello",
    "Data": "world",
    "ResponseHost": "127.0.0.1:7721",
    "KeyCreateTime": "2019-04-09T17:50:59.458104+08:00"
}  
```

| --- | --- | --- |
|  200    |  SUCCESS   |   normal  |
