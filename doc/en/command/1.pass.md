The Data value in the result is the value of the token parameter that needs to be sent when the change data request is sent. 
The valid time value of the token is forever by default. You can set the <Tonken_expire_time> option in the configuration file owlcache.conf, and the time unit is seconds.  
★★★★★ The token will record the IP address when it is set, and will check whether the IP address has changed during verification. If it has changed, your permissions will be invalidated.
