 🦉owlcache is a lightweight, high-performance, non-centralized, distributed Key/Value in-memory Cache written in Go.It is an independent process and high-performance data middleware, and provides a variety of data get and import methods.You can query a node's key to get all the content with the same key in the node cluster(One Key to Many Values). After operating the Key of a node, the data will be automatically synchronized to all node clusters.       


## Highlights and features

* 💡Cross-platform operation
* 🚀Single node ultra high performance
* ⛓Non-centralized, distributed
* 🎯One Key to Many Values
* 🌈Data concurrency security
* 🔍Support data expiration
* 🖥Key/Value Data storage
* 🎨Easy to use, only a few operating commands
* ⚔️Authentication
* 📝Logging
* 🔭**Support TCP and HTTP/HTTPS, WebSocket (Search) connections**  
* 🍻**Support Memcache、 Redis(String)、Url data import**

## How to compile
<details>
<summary>Show</summary>  

### How to compile
Compilation environment requirements
* golang >= 1.16

Source download  
* Go command download (will automatically download the dependent library, if you directly download the source code will prompt the class library is missing)  

```shell
go get -u github.com/xssed/owlcache
```

#### ⚠⚠⚠If 'go mod' is ON in your go locale, you need to create a directory locally on your computer, enter the directory, and execute ` git clone https://github.com/xssed/owlcache.git `Command to download the source code.

### Build
* Enter the owlcache home directory and execute the compilation command (in gopath mode, enter the owlcache home directory of gopath directory, and in gomod mode, enter the local directory you created in the previous prompt) 

```shell
go build
```

### Run
* Note that the owlcache.conf file should be in the same directory as the main program.     
* The .conf configuration file must be a uniform UTF-8 encoding.  
* Set the <Pass> option in the configuration file owlcache.conf.     

Linux
```shell
./owlcache
```
Windows (DOS)  
* If you plan to use cmd.exe to run owlcache for a long time, please right-click and select [Properties]->[Options]->Close [Quick Edit Mode] and [Insert Mode] in the pop-up menu, otherwise long-running owlcache will appear Caton or dormancy phenomenon.     
```shell
owlcache
```

Parameter help
* You can check out the help before running.
* Note that the runtime configuration parameters take precedence over the configuration parameters in the *.conf file.

```shell
owlcache -help
```
```shell

## Simple use example
### Single node to get the Key value
* TCP
command: `get <key>\n`
~~~shell
get hello\n
~~~

* HTTP
Note: HTTP access data is not verified by password, only other operations that change data require authentication.


|Request parameter        | Parameter value         | 
| ------------- |:-------------: |
| cmd           |  get           | 
| key           |  key name        | 

~~~shell
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7721/data/?cmd=get&key=hello"
~~~

* Websocket
command: `get <key>`
~~~shell
get hello
~~~

<br>

Response result example:
~~~shell
world
~~~
If it is an HTTP request, there will be Key details in the response message.  
Key: hello  
Keycreatetime: 2021-11-26 18:12:45.1932019 +0800 CST  
Responsehost: 127.0.0.1:7721  


### Single node to get the Key value info
* TCP
command: `get <key> info\n`
~~~shell
get hello info\n
~~~

* HTTP
>owlcache version >= 0.4.2, http no longer supports 'info'

~~`http://127.0.0.1:7721/data/?cmd=get&key=hello&valuedata=info`~~

* Websocket
command: `get <key> info <Custom return string (not necessary, such as UUID)>`
~~~shell
get hello info
~~~
or
~~~shell
get hello info 5c9eff00-3bed-4113-a095-2f3c771683d9
~~~

Response result example:
~~~shell
{
    "Cmd": "get",
    "Status": 200,
    "Results": "SUCCESS",
    "Key": "hello",
    "Data": "d29ybGQ=",
    "ResponseHost": "127.0.0.1:7721",
    "KeyCreateTime": "2021-11-09T14:12:36.8431596+08:00"
}
~~~

**Attention to the HTTP Status code returned by the HTTP Request. please refer to the "Protocol" chapter.**

### The cluster obtains the Key value.
* Suppose there are now three owlcache HTTP services: 127.0.0.1: 7721, 127.0.0.1:7723, 127.0.0.1:7725. Each service has a data called **Key** called **hello**.


|Request parameter        | Parameter value           | 
| ------------- |:-------------: |
| cmd           |  get           | 
| key           |  key name        | 


~~~shell
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7721/group_data/?cmd=get&key=hello"
~~~
<br>

Response result example:   
~~~shell
world
~~~
The result obtained is the latest value of the update time in the cluster query.


### The cluster obtains the key value information
~~~shell
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7721/group_data/?cmd=get&key=hello&valuedata=info"
~~~
<br>

Response result example:   
~~~shell
[
    {
        "Address": "127.0.0.1:7721",
        "Data": "d29ybGQ=",
        "Key": "hello",
        "KeyCreateTime": "2025-02-21T13:02:35.5876031+08:00",
        "Status": 200
    },
    {
        "Address": "127.0.0.1:7723",
        "Data": "d29ybGQ=",
        "Key": "hello",
        "KeyCreateTime": "2025-02-20T13:02:35.5876031+08:00",
        "Status": 200
    },
    {
        "Address": "127.0.0.1:7725",
        "Data": "d29ybGQ=",
        "Key": "hello",
        "KeyCreateTime": "2025-02-18T13:02:35.5876031+08:00",
        "Status": 200
    }
]

~~~
The result is the information about which node in the cluster owns this Key.

### When querying a cluster, you can specify a target node to improve query efficiency
~~~shell
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7721/group_data/?cmd=get&key=hello&target=127.0.0.1:7723&valuedata=info"
~~~
<br>

Response result example:   
~~~shell
[
    {
        "Address": "127.0.0.1:7723",
        "Data": "d29ybGQ=",
        "Key": "hello",
        "KeyCreateTime": "2025-02-20T13:02:35.5876031+08:00",
        "Status": 200
    }
]

~~~
The result is information about the specified node in the cluster that owns the Key.

## FAQ 

#### 1.owlcache does not have master-slave mode. If a key is written to a node and the node crashes, then the key cannot be accessed?？  
> The author believes that the master-slave mode will occupy a lot of server resources and cause excessive data redundancy(Exception: One Key maps multiple values). It is recommended that important keys can be written to more than two nodes at the same time when setting, so that the access to keys is almost unaffected in the relative case. If all nodes in the cluster are down, it is really impossible to access the key.   

#### 2.How to choose the cluster mode of owlcache?  
> There are three clustering modes of owlcache, namely "Http" (short link), "Websocket" (long link) and "Gossip" (data is eventually consistent).  
> ★If your business volume is small, you can choose the "Http" (short link) cluster method.  
> ★If your business volume is large, you can choose the "Websocket" (long link) cluster method.   
> ★The "Gossip" (data eventually consistent) clustering method does not conflict with the previous two clustering methods, and they can coexist. However, you need to pay attention to the configuration items and debug the complex server network environment. You can understand that the previous two methods are active clustering, and the latter is passive clustering,Used to synchronize data in the cluster.However, if you turn on "Gossip", the use case of your cluster having multiple values ​​for one key will become meaningless.
